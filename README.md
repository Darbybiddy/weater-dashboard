 ## Challenges

 I was struggling with this project for a while. I found that i dont really understand server side API as well as i need to in order to get this done. I had to get multiple tutoring sessions to get through this because im really struggling with this. 

 ## Goal

 Im going to make more time to dig deeper into learning how to get through javascript.
